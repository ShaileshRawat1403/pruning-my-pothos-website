<p class="lead">Attention debt is the interest you pay when you spend your focus without a plan.</p>

Every tab, alert, and quick check feels small in the moment. Together they become a bill: context lost, momentum broken, and a mind that feels scattered even on quiet days. That is the math of <span class="highlight">fragmented attention</span>.

The fix is not a purge. It is a habit of repayment. Close loops, name priorities, and protect one deep block each day. You are not being rigid; you are being kind to your future self.

When attention is treated like a budget, it stops feeling like a leak. It becomes a tool again.
