<p class="lead">Kindness needs constraints or it turns into resentment.</p>

Saying yes to everything is not generosity. It is a slow way of disappearing. A clear boundary is not a wall; it is a <span class="highlight">shape that keeps you whole</span>.

Constraints make care sustainable. They give your effort a form, your time a value, and your attention a home. Without them, even good work becomes a blur.

Kindness with limits feels like trust, not exhaustion.
