<p class="lead">A single missing key in a JSON payload taught me that assumptions are the weakest link in any system integration.</p>

We had built what we believed was a robust agentic workflow. The model generated clean JSON, the parsing was smooth, and the initial tests were all green. We felt confident that our prompt constraints would prevent formatting errors.

Then, we updated the system prompt to add a minor instruction. Suddenly, the model began returning a list of strings instead of a single string for one key. The parser threw an unhandled exception, and the entire pipeline stalled.

I spent hours debugging what was ultimately a translation error. <span class="highlight">The failure occurred because we had treated the model output as a guaranteed database row rather than a probabilistic stream.</span>

This experience forced us to rethink our architecture. We realized that we had built integration points on assumptions. We immediately rewrote our integration layers to include strict runtime contract validation.

I think of the integration layer as a defense system. I no longer assume the generator will follow instructions. Instead, I validate at the boundary, ensuring the core logic is protected from upstream drift.
