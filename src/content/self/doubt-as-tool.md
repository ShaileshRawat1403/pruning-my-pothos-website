<p class="lead">Doubt is a hinge, not a wall.</p>

It keeps you from confusing speed with wisdom. A little uncertainty forces you to ask what you might be missing. That question is the <span class="highlight">start of rigor</span>.

The goal is not to remove doubt but to use it. Make a small test, lower the risk, and learn in motion. Doubt can be a compass when it points to what you need to check.

When used well, it makes decisions cleaner, not slower.
