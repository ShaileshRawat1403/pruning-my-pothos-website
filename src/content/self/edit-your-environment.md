<p class="lead">Environment is the quiet coauthor of your habits.</p>

If your desk invites distraction, your day will comply. If your tools are clean and ready, your work becomes easier to begin. <span class="highlight">Friction is design</span>.

Editing the environment is not vanity. It is choosing what you are likely to become. Small shifts compound faster than big speeches.

Change the room, and the mind follows.
