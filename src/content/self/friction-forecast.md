<p class="lead">Forecasts are a kindness to your future momentum.</p>

Every project has a rough patch. If you name it early, it loses its surprise power. That is a <span class="highlight">friction forecast</span>.

Write down the likely stalls: unclear scope, missing access, low energy. Then add one small countermeasure. The goal is not perfection; it is fewer avoidable stalls.

Preparation does not remove friction, it makes it survivable.
