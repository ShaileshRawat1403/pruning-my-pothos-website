<p class="lead">A habit is a story you tell with your hands.</p>

Identity is not only a narrative in your head. It is the repetition you can see. The habit you keep becomes a <span class="highlight">biography in motion</span>.

Start with the smallest action that proves the story. One page, one walk, one promise kept. The self is built by these tiny receipts.

What you repeat, you become.
