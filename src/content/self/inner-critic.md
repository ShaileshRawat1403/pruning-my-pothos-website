<p class="lead">The inner critic is a misdirected protector.</p>

It tries to keep you safe by keeping you small. You do not need to silence it; you need to <span class="highlight">reassign its job</span>.

Ask it for specifics. What exactly is wrong? What small change would help? Vague fear becomes a clear task when you make it concrete.

A critic that can edit is far less dangerous than one that can only shame.
