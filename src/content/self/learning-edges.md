<p class="lead">You grow at the edge of what you can almost do.</p>

Comfort is warm, but it does not stretch. The learning edge is that slight discomfort where you still have agency. It is the <span class="highlight">zone of workable struggle</span>.

Spend time there on purpose. Not too long, not too easy. Progress likes a steady edge.

Go to the boundary, then come back with a better map.
