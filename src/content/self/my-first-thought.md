<p class="lead">The first thought feels fast and certain. That is exactly why it needs company.</p>

A <span class="highlight">first thought</span> is rarely the best one. It is an instinct, a knee-jerk reaction shaped by biases we don't fully perceive. It arrives with a feeling of clarity and authority, yet it is often just the most well-worn path in our own neural landscape. The most familiar answer, not the most considered one.

The real work does not begin until the <span class="highlight">second or third thought</span>. The work begins when you ask: "Why did I think that first?" This act of <span class="highlight">self-interrogation</span> is the start of genuine reflection. It moves beyond mere reaction and into the realm of reasoning.

To question your first thought is an act of <span class="highlight">intellectual humility</span>. It is an admission that our minds are not perfect instruments of logic, but organic systems shaped by history and habit. The goal is not to never have a bad first thought, but to build the <span class="highlight">discipline not to stop there</span>.

The second thought does not need to be brilliant. It just needs to be honest.
