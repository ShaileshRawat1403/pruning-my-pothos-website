<p class="lead">Unfinished questions are compasses, not gaps.</p>

Some questions should stay open for a while. They keep you attentive and humble. An open question is a <span class="highlight">living prompt</span>.

Return to it regularly. Let it refine your choices without demanding immediate answers. A good question grows with you.

What you keep asking, you keep becoming.
