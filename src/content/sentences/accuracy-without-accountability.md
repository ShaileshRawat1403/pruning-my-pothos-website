A system can be accurate, but if no one is responsible for its output, that accuracy is meaningless. It is a number without a context, a fact without a purpose. It is noise.

Accountability is the anchor that gives accuracy its weight. It is the commitment to stand behind the information, to own the consequences of its use. Without accountability, accuracy becomes a game of statistics, a chase for a metric that has no real-world impact.

When we build systems, we are not just building tools. We are building relationships of trust. And trust requires accountability. It requires knowing that someone is responsible, that someone will answer for the errors.

**What this changes in practice:** For any system that generates information, define who is accountable for its accuracy. If no one is accountable, the information should not be trusted.
