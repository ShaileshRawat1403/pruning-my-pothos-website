When we use ambiguous language, we are taking on a form of debt. We are borrowing clarity from the future. We are pushing the hard work of interpretation onto our reader, or onto our future self.

This debt accrues interest. A small ambiguity now can lead to a large misunderstanding later. A lack of clarity in a requirements document can lead to weeks of wasted work. A vague statement in a contract can lead to a costly lawsuit.

The cost of ambiguity is often hidden. We do not see the time that is wasted in clarification, the rework that is caused by misunderstanding, the trust that is eroded by confusion. But the cost is real.

**What this changes in practice:** Pay down your ambiguity debt as quickly as possible. When you encounter a piece of unclear language, don't just work around it. Fix it.
