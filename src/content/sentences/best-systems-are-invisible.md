When a system is working perfectly, it does not draw attention to itself. It becomes part of the environment, a quiet enabler of our goals. Think of a well-designed tool, a familiar workflow, or a deeply ingrained habit. We do not notice the system; we only notice the outcome.

This invisibility is a sign of success. It means the system has become so intuitive, so reliable, that it requires no conscious effort to use. The friction is gone. The work flows through it.

The goal of a designer or a builder should be to create this kind of seamless experience. To build systems that are so effective they disappear, leaving only the task at hand.

**What this changes in practice:** Design for the background, not the foreground. Aim to reduce cognitive load until your system feels like an extension of the user's own mind.
