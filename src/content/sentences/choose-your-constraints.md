We often think of constraints as a limitation, a barrier to creativity. But constraints are not the enemy of creativity. They are its partner. They are the frame that gives the picture its form.

A blank canvas is intimidating. A problem without constraints is unsolvable. It is the act of choosing our constraints that gives us a starting point. It is the decision to limit our options that allows us to move forward.

The right constraints force us to be resourceful. They push us to find novel solutions. They are the difference between a vague intention and a specific plan.

**What this changes in practice:** At the beginning of a project, don't just define the goal. Define the constraints. What are the boundaries you will operate within?
