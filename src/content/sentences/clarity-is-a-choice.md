We often treat clarity as if it were a happy accident, a moment of insight that arrives on its own. But clarity is not a gift. It is the result of hard work. It is the choice to face ambiguity and wrestle it into submission.

To choose clarity is to choose focus. It is to decide what matters and what does not. It is to trim away the details that distract and to amplify the signal that guides. This is an act of will, not of inspiration.

The world does not hand us clarity. The world hands us noise. Our job is to filter that noise, to find the pattern, to make the choice.

**What this changes in practice:** At the start of a project, explicitly define what you are *not* doing. The constraints create the clarity.
