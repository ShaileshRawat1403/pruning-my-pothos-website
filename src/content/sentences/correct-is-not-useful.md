An answer can be factually correct but practically useless. It can be technically accurate but strategically wrong. We often chase correctness, assuming that if we get the facts right, the rest will follow. But facts are only part of the story.

Usefulness is about fitness for purpose. A useful answer is one that helps you make a better decision. It is one that fits the context, that understands the intent, that speaks to the need of the moment.

A system that only optimizes for correctness will drown you in data. It will give you a list of facts, but it will not give you a point of view. It will not help you decide what to do next.

**What this changes in practice:** Instead of asking "Is this correct?" ask "Is this useful?" and "Does this help me make a better decision?"
