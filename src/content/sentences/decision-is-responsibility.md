We often treat decisions as preferences. We weigh our options, we pick the one we like best, and we move on. But a decision is not a statement of taste. It is a commitment. It is the acceptance of responsibility for the outcome.

When you make a decision, you are not just choosing a path. You are choosing to own the consequences of that path. You are choosing to be accountable for the result, whether it is good or bad.

To treat a decision as a preference is to abdicate this responsibility. It is to say that if things go wrong, it is not your fault. But it is always your fault. The decision was yours to make.

**What this changes in practice:** Before making a decision, ask yourself: "Am I willing to be responsible for the outcome of this choice?"
