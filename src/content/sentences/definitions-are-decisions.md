We often treat definitions as if they are neutral descriptions of reality. But a definition is not a description. It is a decision. It is a choice to draw a line in a particular place, to include certain things and to exclude others.

When we define a term, we are making a decision about what matters. We are creating a category, and that category will shape how we see the world. It will determine what we measure, what we value, and what we build.

The act of defining is an act of power. It is the power to shape the conversation, to set the agenda, to control the frame. It is a strategic act, and it should be treated as such.

**What this changes in practice:** Don't just accept the default definitions. Question them. Ask: "Who does this definition serve? What does it include? What does it exclude? And what other definitions are possible?"
