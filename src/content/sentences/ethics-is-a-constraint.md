We often treat ethics as a separate layer, a conversation that happens after the real work is done. We build the thing, and then we ask if it is good. But by then, the choices have already been made. The values have been set in code.

Ethics is not a checklist. It is a design constraint. It is a set of boundaries that you impose on the solution space. Like performance, security, or usability, it must be considered from the beginning.

A system built without ethical constraints will optimize for something else. It will optimize for engagement, for efficiency, for speed. And it will do so at the expense of fairness, of safety, of dignity.

**What this changes in practice:** For every feature, ask: "How could this be used to harm?" and "What are we optimizing for?"
