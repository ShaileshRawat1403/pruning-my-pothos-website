We often treat a first draft as a failed attempt at a final version. We see the flaws, the gaps, the awkward phrasing, and we feel discouraged. But a first draft is not a failure. It is data.

The first draft is a low-fidelity sketch of the problem space. It shows you the shape of your ideas, the connections between them, and the places where your thinking is still fuzzy. It is a map of your own understanding.

To treat a first draft as data is to shift your mindset from one of judgment to one of curiosity. Instead of asking "Is this good?" you ask "What does this tell me?" You are not trying to produce a finished product. You are trying to generate information.

**What this changes in practice:** Write your first draft as quickly as possible. Don't worry about quality. The goal is to get the ideas out of your head and onto the page, where you can see them.
