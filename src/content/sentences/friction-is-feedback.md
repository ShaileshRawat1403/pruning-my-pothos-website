We often think of friction as a problem to be solved. We want our systems to be seamless, our workflows to be smooth, our progress to be effortless. And so we spend our time trying to remove friction wherever we find it.

But friction is not just a problem. It is also a form of feedback. It is a signal that the system is resisting the change we are trying to make. It is a sign that there is a conflict between our intention and the reality of the situation.

To treat friction as feedback is to shift our mindset from one of annoyance to one of curiosity. Instead of asking "How can I get rid of this friction?" we ask "What is this friction telling me?"

**What this changes in practice:** When you encounter friction, don't just push through it. Pause and listen. What is the source of the resistance? What is the system trying to tell you?
