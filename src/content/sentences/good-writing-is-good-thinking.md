The act of writing is not just about recording our thoughts. It is about creating them. When we are forced to translate a vague idea into precise words, we discover what we truly think. The gaps in our logic are exposed. The weak points become clear.

Clear writing is a service to your reader. But more than that, it is a service to yourself. It is a tool for clarifying your own understanding. If you cannot explain an idea simply, you do not understand it well enough.

This is why we must write. Not just to communicate, but to think. The page is a mirror for our minds.

**What this changes in practice:** If you feel stuck on a problem, try to explain it in writing. The act of writing will often reveal the solution.
