We talk about "human in the loop" as if it were a switch. We imagine that if the AI fails, a human will step in and fix it. But humans are terrible at watching reliable systems wait for a rare failure.

When a system works most of the time, the human observer disengages. We lose context. We lose the muscle memory of doing the task. When the failure finally happens, we are often too distracted to catch it.

Fallback is not a button; it is a culture. It requires active participation, not passive monitoring. If the human is not doing the work occasionally, they will forget how to judge it.

**What this changes in practice:** Design workflows where humans must actively approve or edit, rather than just passively watch.
