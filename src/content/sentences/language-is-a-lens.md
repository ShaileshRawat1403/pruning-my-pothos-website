We tend to think of language as a mirror that reflects the world as it is. But language is not a neutral tool. It is a lens that shapes our perception of reality. The words we use determine what we see and what we ignore.

Every word carries with it a set of assumptions, a history, a point of view. When we choose a word, we are also choosing a frame. We are choosing to highlight certain aspects of reality and to downplay others.

There is no view from nowhere. There is no language that is free of bias. The best we can do is to be aware of the lens we are using, and to be willing to try on other lenses from time to time.

**What this changes in practice:** When you are faced with a disagreement, pay attention to the language being used. Often, the conflict is not about the facts, but about the frames.
