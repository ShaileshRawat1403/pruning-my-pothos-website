A metaphor is more than just a figure of speech. It is a model for understanding. When we use a metaphor, we are borrowing the structure of one idea and applying it to another. This can be a powerful tool for clarification, but it can also be a trap.

Every metaphor highlights certain features of a concept and hides others. If we say that "argument is war," we are emphasizing the confrontational aspects of disagreement and downplaying the collaborative ones. If we say that "time is money," we are encouraged to think of our time as a resource to be spent, not as an experience to be savored.

The metaphors we use are not neutral. They shape our thinking in subtle ways. They can open up new possibilities, or they can lock us into a single way of seeing.

**What this changes in practice:** Pay attention to the metaphors you and others use. Ask yourself: "What does this metaphor highlight? What does it hide? And what other metaphors could I use instead?"
