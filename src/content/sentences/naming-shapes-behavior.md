The names we give things are not just labels. They are frames. They shape how we see the world, what we pay attention to, and what we believe is possible. A name can be a handle for a complex idea, or it can be a box that limits our thinking.

When we name something, we are making a decision about what matters. We are drawing a boundary around a concept and giving it a distinct identity. This act of naming is an act of power. It is the power to define, to include, and to exclude.

Choose your names with care. A good name can clarify a difficult idea. A bad name can create confusion and mistrust. A name is a small thing, but it has the power to shape behavior on a large scale.

**What this changes in practice:** When you are trying to change a behavior, start by changing the name. A new name can create a new way of seeing.
