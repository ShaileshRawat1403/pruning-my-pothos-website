We often talk about people who are "observant" as if it were an innate quality, a gift that some people have and others do not. But noticing is not a trait. It is a skill. It is a form of attention that can be cultivated and trained.

To train the skill of noticing, you must first believe that it is trainable. You must believe that you can get better at seeing the world. You must be willing to look past the obvious and to question your own assumptions.

The practice of noticing is simple: pay attention. Pay attention to the details that others miss. Pay attention to the small shifts in a pattern. Pay attention to the things that do not fit. Over time, you will build the muscle of observation.

**What this changes in practice:** Set aside time each day to simply observe. Look at a familiar object as if you were seeing it for the first time. Write down what you notice.
