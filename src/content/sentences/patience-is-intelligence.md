In a world that prizes speed, patience can seem like a weakness. We are told to move fast, to decide quickly, to act now. But speed without direction is just churn. It is motion without progress.

Patience is the ability to wait for the right moment. It is the wisdom to know that some problems are not solved by force, but by time. It is the discipline to let an idea mature, to let a situation unfold, to let the noise die down.

This is not a passive act. It is an active choice to resist the pull of urgency. It is a form of attention, a way of seeing the larger pattern instead of reacting to the immediate signal.

**What this changes in practice:** When you feel pressured to make a quick decision, pause. Ask yourself: "What would happen if I waited?"
