We are often so excited by a new capability that we rush to deploy it. We focus on the power it gives us, the problems it can solve. But we forget to ask what new problems it might create.

Power without policy is dangerous. It is a force without direction. It is a tool without a user manual. Before we unleash a new power, we must first establish the rules that will govern it.

  <figcaption>Policy is the gate that makes power safe to use.</figcaption>
</figure>

Policy is the act of anticipating consequences. It is the work of setting boundaries, of defining acceptable use, of creating a framework for accountability. It is the boring, essential work that makes innovation safe.

**What this changes in practice:** Before you ship a new technology, write the policy for its use. Define the red lines before you cross them.
