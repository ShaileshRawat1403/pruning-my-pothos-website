<p class="lead">Sentences are the smallest machines of meaning we carry. They turn instinct into language, and language into shared direction.</p>

A sentence is not just a string of words. It is a structure that can be repeated, tested, and revised until it holds. When it holds, people can align on it. When it does not, the system drifts.

A foundation sentence does three jobs:

- **Name the focus.** It tells everyone what the system should pay attention to.
- **Bound the scope.** It marks what is included and what is not.
- **Invite response.** It makes disagreement possible without confusion.

**What this changes in practice:**** Write the sentence that aligns your team before you add more.
