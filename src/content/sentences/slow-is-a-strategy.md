The pressure to move fast is immense. We are told that speed is a competitive advantage, that to hesitate is to lose. But not all races are won by the swift. Some are won by the steady.

Choosing to go slow is a strategic decision. It is a choice to prioritize quality over speed, to favor deliberation over impulse. It is the recognition that some things cannot be rushed. Trust, for example, is built slowly. Insight is cultivated slowly.

A deliberate pace allows for reflection. It creates space for feedback. It reduces the risk of costly mistakes. It is not about being lazy; it is about being effective.

**What this changes in practice:** When faced with a complex problem, resist the urge to rush. Give yourself permission to go slow.
