Large failures rarely appear out of nowhere. They are often preceded by a series of small signals, a chain of near misses, a pattern of minor deviations. These signals are easy to dismiss in the moment, but in retrospect, they are often the clearest early warnings of a larger problem.

The challenge is to see these signals for what they are. To treat them not as isolated incidents, but as data points in a larger trend. To resist the urge to explain them away, and instead to ask: "What might this be an indicator of?"

This requires a culture of vigilance. It requires a willingness to listen to the quiet voices of dissent, to pay attention to the metrics that are just slightly off, to investigate the anomalies that seem harmless.

**What this changes in practice:** When you see a small problem, don't just fix it. Ask why it happened. Look for the systemic issue that allowed it to occur.
