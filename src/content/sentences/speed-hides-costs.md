We are addicted to speed. We want our food fast, our answers fast, our results fast. And we are willing to pay a price for it. But the price is often higher than we think.

Speed hides the cost of poor quality. When we move too quickly, we make mistakes. We take shortcuts. We accumulate debt, both technical and organizational. These costs are not immediately visible, but they will come due in time.

Speed also hides the cost of lost opportunity. When we are in a hurry, we do not have time to think. We do not have time to explore alternative paths. We do not have time to ask the question that would lead to a breakthrough.

**What this changes in practice:** When you are tempted to choose the fast option, ask yourself: "What are the hidden costs of this speed?"
