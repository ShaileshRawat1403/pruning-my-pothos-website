We often confuse having data with having expertise. We feed manuals into a model and expect it to become an expert. But data is just the record of past decisions; expertise is the ability to make new ones.

An AI can mimic the pattern of an expert answer. It can use the jargon, the structure, and the tone. But it cannot weigh the trade-offs that are not written down. It cannot feel the weight of a decision.

Expertise is not about knowing the answer. It is about knowing which questions matter in a specific moment. It is a filter, not a generator.

**What this changes in practice:** Use AI to generate options, but keep the expert in the loop to select the truth.
