This started from a familiar failure mode. Early agent demos looked impressive, but as soon as tasks became multi-step, the system became hard to trust. Tools executed in surprising order, state went out of sync, and success messages appeared without proof.

The core lesson was simple: model reasoning is probabilistic, but system execution must be controlled. So instead of building a tool-calling chatbot, I built `workspace-mcp` as a runtime kernel with explicit orchestration rules.

## Architecture map

The most important boundary is this:

`think` and `act` are separated.

The model can think and propose. The runtime can approve, deny, execute, verify, and record.

</figure>

## What happened

The first version followed the typical pattern: prompt in, tool call out, answer back. It was fast to build and good for demos, but unreliable for sustained use.

Three problems kept repeating:

- tool calls retried in loops
- write operations happened without strong guardrails
- success was claimed before verification

## The two gates

The first gate is **permission governance**.
Before a tool runs, the runtime must decide: allow, deny, or ask user.

The second gate is **contract integrity**.
If response shape drifts, clients become fragile and audit trails become noisy.

  <figcaption>Internally, this is orchestration infrastructure: policy, tools, patches, and traces move as one system.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Message parts timeline

DAX-style event streaming becomes much easier to inspect when each response is split into structured parts instead of one long string. This is the timeline model that keeps execution debuggable.

</figure>

## Setup walkthrough

1. Enter the `workspace-mcp` package in the Soothsayer repo.
2. Install in editable mode with dev tooling.
3. Start the kernel with explicit workspace and profile.
4. Run a controlled lifecycle, not ad hoc tool calls.

```bash
cd workspace-mcp
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

```bash
workspace-mcp --workspace-root /tmp/workspace --profile dev
```

## First-time config

Project policy layering is where this becomes useful in real teams. The packaged kernel policy is stable, while each workspace can overlay tighter controls.

```bash
workspace-mcp \
  --workspace-root ./examples/minimal-project/workspace \
  --policy-path ./examples/minimal-project/project_policy.yaml \
  --profile dev
```

A minimal lifecycle should always follow this order:

1. `kernel_version`
2. `self_check`
3. `start_run`
4. `repo_search`
5. `create_change_bundle`
6. `bundle_report`
7. `end_run`
8. `get_run_summary`

This keeps every change traceable to one explicit run context.

## Quick checks

Build-time confidence:

```bash
pytest -q
ruff check .
mypy src
```

Deterministic hash parity:

```bash
python spec-tests/generate_bundle_hashes.py --check
```

Runtime behavior sanity:

```bash
workspace-mcp --workspace-root /tmp/workspace --profile read_only
```

For CI hardening, run the kernel under `ci` profile and assert blocked write flows return canonical violations instead of tool output.

## Failure modes

- Starting without `start_run`, then assuming subsequent steps are connected.
- Letting the model call tools directly without a policy decision boundary.
- Trusting success text without verification evidence.
- Treating violations as free-form errors rather than structured contract outputs.
- Ignoring loop behavior (repeated tool intents) until runtime costs spike.

## What made the difference

These decisions made the runtime resilient:

- Enforce runtime invariants (`meta` shape, code alignment, timestamp format).
- Make lifecycle explicit (`run_id`, owner scoping, bounded run store).
- Keep patch/change artifacts deterministic and hash-based.
- Record policy decisions in audit logs that can be explained later.

That moved the system from "assistant behavior" to "orchestrated execution."

## What I would do next time

I would add three integration harnesses on day one: one CLI loop, one IDE loop, one CI loop. The runtime is stable only when contract assumptions are tested from each client surface, not just from unit tests.

If you want the design lens behind this implementation, [Dual NLP framework](/dual-nlp-framework/) explains the planning language this runtime operationalizes.
