This note compiles our practices for designing and maintaining structured schemas at the interface boundaries of generative systems.

### Core Guidelines

- **Decouple the Generator:** Never let the model output format dictate your database schema. Always translate model-specific payloads into application-level entities.
- **Fail Gracefully:** Implement fallback strategies (like default fields or self-repair loops) when output validation fails.
- **Version Your Schemas:** As prompt requirements shift, version your schema interfaces to support legacy runtimes.

By enforcing these boundaries, we isolate change and protect downstream stability.
