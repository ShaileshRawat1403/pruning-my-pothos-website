Every system I build competes for attention, including my own. If the system wastes attention, it wastes time. If it protects attention, it compounds time.

I design for frictionless focus: fewer steps, clearer defaults, less noise. This is not minimalism for its own sake. It is respect for the user's mind.

When something feels cluttered, I assume attention is leaking. Fixing the leak often fixes the outcome.
