I learned this from designing small systems: when options are endless, decisions drift. When options are constrained, intent surfaces and work starts.

Constraints are not punishments. They are a way to name what matters and to ignore what does not. Good constraints reduce noise, then give your attention a path.

I return to this when a project feels vague. I do not add more features; I remove degrees of freedom.
