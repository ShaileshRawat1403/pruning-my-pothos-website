I learned to treat decisions as commitments, not reactions. A fast yes often hides an unspoken no. A slow yes is a sign that the idea can survive friction.

When the answer is not clear, I wait. I test in small ways and let evidence build. The goal is not to move fast. The goal is to move on purpose.

This habit saves time because it avoids rework and regret. It also protects trust, which is slower to rebuild than any feature.
