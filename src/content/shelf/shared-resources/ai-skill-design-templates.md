These templates are for the moment when a useful prompt starts repeating often enough that it should become a reusable capability.

The goal is not to create documentation overhead. The goal is to make repeated work clearer, safer, and easier to hand off.

## Skill definition template

```yaml
name:
objective:
inputs:
constraints:
tools:
output_format:
success_criteria:
failure_modes:
escalation:
```

Use this when a repeated task needs a stable contract.

## Skill review template

```yaml
skill_version:
change_summary:
expected_behavior_change:
test_cases:
rollback_note:
```

Use this when a skill changes and you want the behavior shift to stay explicit.

## Skill composition template

```yaml
trigger:
upstream_context:
skill_execution:
output_contract:
downstream_handoff:
```

Use this when one skill becomes part of a wider workflow.

These templates work best when paired with:

- [Skills vs Prompts vs Agents](/systems/skills-vs-prompts-vs-agents/)
- [Dual NLP for AI-assisted SDLC](/dual-nlp-framework/)
