## Benefits

- Small commits make experiments reversible.
- Branches let you try without fear.
- Diff is a thinking tool, not just a log.

## Prerequisites

- A consistent commit habit.
- A basic branching model.

## Quick snippets

```bash
git status
git checkout -b experiment/ollama-launch
```

## Resources

- [Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
- [Git reference](https://git-scm.com/docs)

## Where it fails

Large, infrequent commits hide the real story of the work.
