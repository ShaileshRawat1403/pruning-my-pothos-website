## Benefits

- Low heat and battery drain for long local runs.
- Solid driver support for common AI and dev stacks.
- Fast I/O keeps model pulls and builds predictable.

## Prerequisites

- Apple Silicon hardware (M1/M2/M3).
- Enough RAM for your largest local model.

## Quick snippets

```bash
uname -m
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Chip"
```

## Where it fails

Large models still hit memory ceilings and can bottleneck on unified memory bandwidth.
