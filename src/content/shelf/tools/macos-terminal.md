## Benefits

- One command is a repeatable habit.
- Scripts become living documentation.
- Works well with local model stacks.

## Prerequisites

- Comfort with the shell.
- A small set of aliases or scripts.

## Quick snippets

```bash
alias ll="ls -lah"
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
```

## Resources

- [Terminal manual](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/)
- [Zsh manual](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/)

## Where it fails

Complex automation can hide errors if you never inspect logs.
