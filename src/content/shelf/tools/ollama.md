## Benefits

- Local inference without cloud latency.
- Simple model pull and run flow.
- Works well with other CLI tools.

## Prerequisites

- Enough RAM for your target model.
- Disk space for local model files.

## Quick snippets

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama run llama3.1:8b "summarize this"
```

## Where it fails

Large context or multi-user workloads can outgrow local hardware quickly.
