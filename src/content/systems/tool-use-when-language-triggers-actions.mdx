Tool use gives a Large Language Model the ability to interact with the outside world. It transforms the model from a passive text generator into an active agent that can query databases, call APIs, and perform actions. This capability is powerful, but it introduces significant new risks and responsibilities.

## Act I: The fundamentals

### The tool-use loop

By itself, an LLM can only process text. It cannot access real-time information, interact with other software, or affect the physical world. Tool use, also known as function calling, bridges this gap.

The process begins by providing the LLM with a list of available "tools." Each tool is a function in your application's code, described in natural language (e.g., `get_current_weather(location: string)`). When a user issues a prompt, the model can decide that it needs to use one of these tools. Instead of generating a text response, it generates a structured JSON object specifying the tool to call and the arguments to use.

## Act II: The modern paradigm

### Application as gatekeeper

The application code acts as an intermediary. It inspects the JSON object from the LLM and, if it deems the call safe and valid, executes the requested function. For example, if the LLM generates `{ "tool": "get_current_weather", "arguments": { "location": "Boston, MA" } }`, the application would call its internal weather function for Boston.

The result of that function call (e.g., `{ "temperature": "72F", "conditions": "Sunny" }`) is then passed back to the LLM as part of a new prompt. The LLM, now equipped with this real-time information, generates the final, human-readable response: "The current weather in Boston is 72°F and sunny." This entire loop can happen in a single turn of conversation.

## Act III: Principles in practice

### Guardrails and accountability

The moment an LLM can trigger an action, the stakes become much higher. A bug is no longer just a poorly worded sentence; it could be an accidental purchase, a deleted file, or an incorrect database query. This elevates the importance of safety and accountability.

-   **Never trust the LLM's output directly.** Always validate the tool name and arguments against a strict schema before execution.
-   **Implement guardrails.** Use confirmation steps for any destructive or costly actions. A prompt like "Are you sure you want to delete this file?" is a critical safety mechanism.
-   **Provide precise tool descriptions.** The LLM's decision to use a tool is based entirely on the description you provide. Vague or ambiguous descriptions will lead to incorrect tool usage.
-   **Plan for failure.** The tool might fail, an API could be down, or the result might be an error. Your system must be able to handle these failures gracefully and report them back to the LLM.

### What this changes in practice

When you give a model tools, you must shift your focus from prompt quality to a system of validation, error handling, and safety guardrails.
