<Layout title="About | A Thinking Workspace">
  <h1>About This Space</h1>
  <p>
    This website is an experiment in public thinking. It's a place to develop ideas, connect concepts, and document my explorations into technology, systems, and language.
  </p>
  <p>
    The work moves through three modes: technical systems that explain how things function, reflective sentences that slow the thinking down, and poetic sticky notes that keep the raw signal alive.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core thesis is that the process of thinking is as valuable as the finished product. I'm sharing notes, fragments, and long-form essays, in the hope to create a more honest and dynamic representation of my work. The content here is intentionally fluid and subject to change as my understanding evolves.
